# GraphBFS-GraphD
Code for a BFS (breadth-first search) and a graph using Dijkstra's algorithm.
This lab showcases the use of two different types of search
algorithms for Graphs. In the first file, GraphBFS, it uses an adjacency matrix to store the connections between vertices, enabling efficient edge addition and traversal operations. The addEdge method allows for the creation of edges between vertex pairs in an undirected graph by updating the adjacency matrix accordingly. The BFS algorithm implemented in the bfs method utilizes a queue-based approach to traverse the graph layer by layer starting from a specified source node. The main method demonstrates the usage of the GraphBFS class by creating a graph with 5 vertices, adding edges between them, and performing BFS traversal from node 0. In GraphD, the nodes (NodeD) and edges (Edge) with functionality for Dijkstra's algorithm implementation. Each node stores its value, adjacency list, visit status, distance from the start node, and the previous node in the shortest path, with the first file GraphBFS being all my own work (lab partner: Bidika).
